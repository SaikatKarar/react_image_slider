# React image slider project:

This is a simple **React-based Image Slider** with smooth transitions and a toggle button for navigation. The project uses **React Hooks**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Icons** to create a visually appealing and responsive image slider.

   - Uses `useState` to manage the visibility of the current image.

2. **Smooth Transitions**:
   - Implements sliding animations between images using `Tailwind CSS` utilities like `transition-transform` and `duration-300`.

3. **Navigation Button**:
   - Includes a toggle button for switching between images, with intuitive icons (`MdOutlineArrowForwardIos`, `MdOutlineArrowBackIos`) from the `react-icons` library.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Fully responsive layout using `Tailwind CSS` for styling.

## Tech Stack
